<!-- - Summer Internship under Prof. Roman Genov at the University of Toronto funded by MITACS.
- Developed a RISC-V core(in SystemVerilog) to create custom mask sequences on the fly for the coded-exposure image sensors.
- Worked on mask generation and mask decompression modules for generating hard-coded masks and receiving compressed masks. -->

- Developed a RISC-V core in SystemVerilog to create custom mask sequences on the fly for the coded-exposure image sensors.
- Performed verification of the RISC-V core through OpenOCD on a Nexys Video Artix-7 FPGA.
- Improved the Mask generation and Mask decompression modules for generating hard-coded masks and receiving compressed masks leading to a 24.47% gain in performance.
