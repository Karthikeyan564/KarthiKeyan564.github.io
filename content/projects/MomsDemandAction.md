A low-profile Koch modified  monopole antenna backed  with  EBG  plane has  been  designed  in  this  work  for   wearable applications of MBAN band (3.5 GHz) standards.  The  designed  EBG-antenna  is  composed  of  a  triangular-shaped   microstrip antenna as a radiator and a 2 x 2 square-shaped EBG  plane as a reflector.
